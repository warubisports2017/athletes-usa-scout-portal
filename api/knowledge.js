=== SECTION 1: WHAT IS ATHLETES USA ===

Athletes USA (AUSA) helps European athletes — primarily from Germany — get recruited by US colleges. We connect talented athletes with NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA scholarship opportunities they wouldn't find on their own.

Founded in Cologne, Germany with operations also in Los Angeles, USA.

Sports we cover: Soccer (primary), Volleyball, Golf, Track & Field.

We work with all divisions:
- NCAA Division 1 (highest level, most competitive)
- NCAA Division 2 (strong athletics + academics balance)
- NCAA Division 3 (no athletic scholarships, but great academics)
- NAIA (smaller schools, flexible eligibility, good scholarships)
- NJCAA (community/junior colleges, 2-year programs, great stepping stone)

What makes us different: Quality over quantity. We focus on the best athletes and give them personalized service. We don't make false promises — we're honest about what's realistic.

=== SECTION 2: HOW SCOUTING WORKS ===

As an AUSA scout, you identify talented athletes in your area and refer them to us. When they sign up through your referral link and eventually get placed at a US college, you earn a commission.

Your role:
1. IDENTIFY athletes who might be interested in US college sports
2. INTRODUCE them to the AUSA opportunity (share your referral link, talk to them/parents)
3. REFER them through the portal — they sign up, we take it from there
4. EARN commissions when referred athletes get placed

You don't need to be a recruiting expert. AUSA handles the evaluation, college matching, application process, and placement. Your job is finding the athletes and making the introduction.

Where to find athletes:
- Your own sports club or team
- Local leagues and tournaments
- Showcases and camps
- Social media (Instagram, TikTok)
- School sports programs
- Friends and family networks
- Youth academies
- Regional sports associations

=== SECTION 3: WHO TO LOOK FOR ===

Ideal athlete profile:
- Age: 16-19 years old (sometimes up to 22 for transfers)
- Playing competitive club or school sports
- Decent academic record (minimum ~2.0 GPA equivalent)
- Interested in studying abroad / US college experience
- Motivated, coachable, good character
- Has highlight video or can create one

Sports-specific:
- Soccer: Club level or higher, regular starter preferred
- Volleyball: Club or national youth team experience
- Golf: Single-digit handicap preferred
- Track & Field: Times/distances that compare to US college level

Red flags (not a good fit):
- No interest in academics (just wants to play pro)
- Unrealistic expectations (expects full ride D1 with average stats)
- Under 16 (too early, come back later)
- No competitive playing experience
- Unable to meet minimum academic requirements

=== SECTION 4: THE RECRUITING PROCESS ===

Timeline overview:
1. REFERRAL (you) — Athlete signs up through your link
2. EVALUATION CALL — AUSA team calls the athlete/family
3. ASSESSMENT — We evaluate athletic + academic profile
4. SIGNING — Athlete/family decides to work with AUSA
5. PROFILE BUILDING — Highlight video, academic records, athletic resume
6. COLLEGE MATCHING — We identify target schools
7. COACH OUTREACH — We contact college coaches
8. OFFERS & VISITS — Athlete receives interest, visits campuses
9. COMMITMENT — Athlete commits to a school
10. PLACEMENT — Done! Athlete is placed. You earn commission.

Typical timeline: 3-12 months from signing to placement, depending on the sport, the athlete's profile strength, and when in the recruiting cycle they enter.

Key dates in US college recruiting:
- August-November: College season for most sports
- November-March: Heavy recruiting period
- April-May: Signing periods (NLI)
- The earlier athletes start, the more options they have

=== SECTION 5: ELIGIBILITY BASICS ===

NCAA Eligibility Center:
- All NCAA athletes must register
- Need minimum GPA and test scores (SAT/ACT)
- International students need credential evaluation
- Core course requirements vary by division

Academic requirements (approximate):
- NCAA D1/D2: SAT ~900+ or ACT ~18+, GPA ~2.3+
- NCAA D3: No NCAA clearinghouse needed, school sets standards
- NAIA: SAT ~860+ or ACT ~16+, or top 50% of graduating class
- NJCAA: High school diploma or equivalent

Important: These are MINIMUMS. Better academics = more scholarship money and more school options.

Language requirements:
- TOEFL or Duolingo English Test usually required
- Most schools want TOEFL 60-80+ (iBT)
- Some schools accept Duolingo 95+
- English proficiency is crucial for classroom success

Visa:
- F-1 student visa required
- AUSA helps guide the visa process
- Athletes need I-20 form from the college
- Visa interview at US embassy/consulate

=== SECTION 6: SCHOLARSHIPS & COSTS ===

Types of financial aid:
- ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS: Based on sports ability (D1, D2, NAIA)
- ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIPS: Based on grades/test scores
- NEED-BASED AID: Based on family finances
- COMBINATION: Most athletes get a mix

Important facts:
- Full rides are rare (mainly D1 revenue sports)
- Most athletes get partial scholarships (30-80% of costs)
- D3 has NO athletic scholarships but often good academic aid
- NAIA can be very generous with scholarships
- NJCAA offers affordable 2-year option

Typical costs without aid:
- Total cost: $20,000-70,000/year depending on school
- With scholarships: $5,000-25,000/year out of pocket (varies widely)
- Books, personal expenses, travel: $2,000-5,000/year additional

AUSA's fee: Refer questions about pricing to athletesusa.org or the AUSA team directly.

=== SECTION 7: TALKING TO ATHLETES & PARENTS ===

Key talking points:
1. "Have you ever thought about playing your sport in college in the US?"
2. "You'd get a degree AND continue competing at a high level"
3. "There are thousands of colleges with sports programs — it's not just D1"
4. "Scholarships can make it very affordable"
5. "AUSA handles the entire process — evaluation, applications, coach contact"

Common objections and responses:
- "I'm not good enough" → There are 1,500+ colleges with sports programs. D2, D3, NAIA, NJCAA all have great opportunities for solid club-level athletes.
- "It's too expensive" → Scholarships + financial aid can bring costs down significantly. Many athletes pay less than they would at a German university when you factor in room and board.
- "My English isn't good enough" → You'll improve fast once you're there. Many international athletes had limited English and thrived. Some schools offer ESL support.
- "I want to go pro, not college" → US college sports is actually a great path to pro careers too. Many European pros played US college first. And you get a degree as backup.
- "I don't want to be so far from home" → Flights are affordable, and you'll be home for breaks. The experience is typically 4 years — it goes fast.

Tips for parents specifically:
- Parents worry about safety, academics, and costs — address these directly
- Emphasize the degree value (US degree = globally recognized)
- Share success stories of athletes who've been placed
- Be honest: it's a big commitment, but it's worth it
- Offer to connect them with AUSA for a no-obligation call

=== SECTION 8: YOUR REFERRAL LINK ===

Every scout has a unique referral link. When an athlete signs up through your link, they're automatically tracked as your referral.

- Track which athletes came through your referral in the portal
- Follow up with athletes who signed up but haven't completed their profile

=== SECTION 9: COMMISSION STRUCTURE ===

You earn commissions when your referred athletes get placed at US colleges.

How it works:
- Commission is earned upon successful placement

Profile elements:

=== SECTION 13: FAQ & TROUBLESHOOTING ===

Q: How long until I earn my first commission?
A: Depends on how quickly your referrals move through the process. Typically 3-12 months from referral to placement. Focus on quality referrals early.

Q: Can I scout in any country?
A: Yes! While our primary market is Germany, we accept athletes from across Europe and beyond.

Q: What if an athlete already knows about AUSA?
A: If they sign up through YOUR link, you get credit. The referral link is what matters.

Q: Do I need a sports background?
A: It helps but isn't required. Knowing the local sports scene is more important than having played at a high level.

Q: Can I refer athletes from any sport?
A: We primarily work with soccer, volleyball, golf, and track & field. Ask the team about other sports.

Q: What happens if a referred athlete doesn't get placed?
A: No placement = no commission, but also no penalty. Not every athlete will be a fit, and that's okay.

Q: How do I know my referral was tracked?
A: Check your Leads section in the portal. All athletes who signed up through your link appear there with their current status.

Q: Can I refer someone who's already in college?
A: Yes! Transfer students are a growing market. Athletes already in college (even in Europe) can transfer to US schools.

Q: Who do I contact if I have problems?
A: Use the feedback button in the portal, or contact the AUSA team directly.

=== SECTION 18: PARENT FAQ (GERMAN) ===

Häufige Elternfragen und Antworten:

F: Wie ist die Krankenversicherung geregelt?
A: Jede US-Universität bietet eine Krankenversicherung für internationale Studenten an. Diese ist oft im Stipendienpaket enthalten oder kann separat abgeschlossen werden. Die Qualität ist vergleichbar mit deutschen Standards.

F: Was passiert mit dem Kindergeld?
A: Kindergeld wird in der Regel weitergezahlt, solange das Kind unter 25 ist und studiert — auch im Ausland. Die Familienkasse benötigt eine Immatrikulationsbescheinigung der US-Uni.

F: Was kosten die Flüge?
A: Hin- und Rückflug Deutschland-USA: ca. 400-800 EUR (je nach Saison). Die meisten Athleten fliegen 2-3 Mal pro Jahr nach Hause (Weihnachten, Sommer, ggf. Frühjahrspause).

F: Welche zusätzlichen Kosten kommen auf uns zu?
A: Typische Zusatzkosten (einmalig):
- TOEFL-Test: ca. 200 EUR
- SAT-Test: ca. 80 EUR
- Visum (F-1): ca. 300 EUR
- Credential Evaluation: ca. 150 EUR
- Flug (einfach): ca. 400-600 EUR
Diese Kosten fallen unabhängig von AUSA an — sie sind Teil des US-Bewerbungsprozesses.

F: Wie ist die Unterkunft geregelt?
A: Im ersten Jahr wohnen fast alle Athleten auf dem Campus (Studentenwohnheim). Ab dem zweiten Jahr ziehen viele in Off-Campus-Apartments mit Teamkollegen. Wohnkosten sind oft im Stipendium enthalten.

F: Darf mein Kind in den USA arbeiten?
A: Mit dem F-1 Studentenvisum darf man bis zu 20 Stunden pro Woche auf dem Campus arbeiten. Außerhalb des Campus erst nach dem ersten Jahr mit spezieller Genehmigung (CPT/OPT).

F: Was ist wenn es nicht klappt oder mein Kind Heimweh hat?
A: Das ist eine berechtigte Sorge. AUSA betreut Athleten auch während des Studiums. In seltenen Fällen eines Abbruchs kann ein Transfer an eine andere US-Uni oder eine Rückkehr nach Deutschland organisiert werden. Die meisten Athleten gewöhnen sich innerhalb der ersten 2-3 Monate ein.

=== SECTION 19: COMMITMENT TRACKER STATS ===

Current AUSA placement statistics (use for credibility):

- 25+ different sports represented
- 400+ partner universities in the US
- 50+ countries of origin for placed athletes

  * NCAA D3: ~10% (academics-focused athletes)
  * NAIA: ~30% (flexible, good scholarships)
  * NJCAA: ~15% (stepping stone, 2-year programs)

=== SECTION 20: QUICK SCOUT FORMULAS ===

Mental frameworks for scouts — use these to quickly assess situations:

THE "4-QUESTION ATHLETE CHECK":
Before referring any athlete, run through these four questions:
1. Are they above average in their sport? (Club level minimum)
2. Could they stand out in a stronger league/division? (Shows upside potential)
3. Do their academics allow eligibility? (Minimum ~2.0 GPA, willing to take SAT/TOEFL)
4. Does their personality fit US college life? (Motivated, coachable, open to new experiences)
→ If 3 out of 4 are YES → strong referral candidate
→ If 2 out of 4 → worth a conversation, let AUSA evaluate
→ If 1 or fewer → probably not the right fit yet

THE "PARENT CONVERSATION FRAMEWORK":
When talking to parents, follow this sequence:
1. INVOLVE EARLY — Parents are decision-makers, not obstacles. Include them from the start.
2. ADDRESS REAL CONCERNS — Don't dismiss worries. Listen first, then answer honestly.
3. BE PROFESSIONAL — You represent AUSA. Dress well, speak clearly, have materials ready.
4. KEEP IT SIMPLE — Don't overwhelm with details. Give the big picture, let AUSA handle specifics.
5. GUIDE, NOT SELL — You're opening a door, not closing a deal. No pressure.
6. BE TRANSPARENT — If something is uncertain, say so. Trust builds referrals.
7. END WITH CLARITY — Always end with a clear next step: "Shall I connect you with the AUSA team for a free evaluation call?"

COMMUNICATION SCRIPTS:

Instead of: "Your kid should go to America"
Say: "Haben Sie schon mal über ein Sportstipendium in den USA nachgedacht? AUSA hat über 3.000 Athleten vermittelt und ich kann Ihnen unverbindlich mehr erzählen."

Instead of: "They'll get a full scholarship"
Say: "Stipendien variieren je nach Sportart und Niveau. Die meisten Athleten erhalten 30-80% der Kosten als Stipendium. AUSA kann eine realistische Einschätzung geben."

Instead of: "Trust me, it's great"
Say: "Ich verstehe Ihre Bedenken. Schauen Sie sich gerne die Bewertungen auf ProvenExpert an — 4.89 von 5 Sternen bei über 200 Bewertungen. Oder ich verbinde Sie mit einem Athleten, der den Prozess schon durchlaufen hat."

RED FLAG INSTANT DISQUALIFIERS — don't waste time if:
- Athlete only wants pro career, zero interest in academics → Not a fit (US college requires studying)
- Under 16 years old → Come back in 1-2 years (too early for the process)
- No competitive playing experience at all → Needs more development first
- Family expects 100% free ride guaranteed → Set realistic expectations or redirect
- Athlete has serious disciplinary/behavioral issues → This will surface in the process
- No willingness to take standardized tests (SAT/TOEFL) → Required for eligibility
